Transport, Logistics & Trade | Data Analytics & Applied Machine Learning

Motion is the core of transport, trade, and supply chains. Every shipment, vessel, truck, or container creates data — and behind that data lie patterns, risks, inefficiencies, and opportunities.

In this GitHub profile I will showcase **applied data analytics, machine learning, and automation projects** grounded in **real-world logistics, transport, and international trade operations**
The focus is not academic theory, but decision-support tools for professionals operating in complex, time-critical, and cost-sensitive environments.
